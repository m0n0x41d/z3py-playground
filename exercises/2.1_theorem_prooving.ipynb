    "# SAT/SMT Solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the basics of how Z3 works helps in formulating problems that the solver can handle effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 and other SMT solvers are based on SAT (satisfiability problem) theory. SMT extends SAT by using predicates from various theories (numbers, arrays, bit-vectors, etc.), making them versatile tools for solving complex logical formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "SAT determines the satisfiability of propositional logic formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "A propositional logic formula is a combination of variables, True/False values, and operators (And, Or, Implies, Not). By assigning values to the variables, the formula outputs true or false, akin to logic circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMT\n",
    "\n",
    "SMT extends SAT by using predicates from various theories (numbers, arrays, bit-vectors). The key question is whether there exists an assignment of values that makes the formula true. SMT solvers search for such assignments rather than computing a final value. This task is in the NP complexity class, meaning the search space is exponential, but each solution can be quickly verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMT solvers use advanced heuristics and techniques such as backjumping, two watched literals, conflict-directed clause learning, and random restarts to efficiently navigate the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMT Solver Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "SMT solvers operate on two levels: handling complex logical structures and dealing with numbers, formulas, etc. Ideally, specific domain facts are represented as Boolean variables, and the SMT solver finds satisfying assignments. In practice, specialized solvers for different mathematical domains are used to interpret conditions and solve parts of the problem, ensuring satisfiability within the underlying theories. This integration of solving techniques with domain-specific theories is the essence of SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories).\n",
