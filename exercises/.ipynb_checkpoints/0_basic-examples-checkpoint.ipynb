    "And it writes me code in Haskell :D \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here's a solution to the Eight Queens problem using a functional programming approach in Haskell:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "type Position = (Int, Int)\n",
    "\n",
    "eightQueens :: Int -> [[Position]]\n",
    "eightQueens n = solve n\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "1. `Position` is defined as a type alias for a tuple `(Int, Int)` representing a position on the chessboard.\n",
    "2. `eightQueens` takes the size of the board `n` and returns a list of solutions, where each solution is a list of positions.\n",
    "3. `solve` is a recursive function that builds up solutions. It starts with an empty solution for `0` queens.\n",
    "4. For each recursive step, it adds a new queen in column `k`, checking all rows `[1..n]` to ensure the new queen is placed safely.\n",
    "5. `safe` checks if a position `(x, y)` is safe with respect to the already placed queens in the list `ps`.\n",
    "6. The `main` function prints all the solutions for the 8x8 chessboard.\n",

    "Lets try this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "YOU ARE THE WORLD'S FOREMOST EXPERT IN SOLVING THE \"EIGHT QUEENS PUZZLE,\" A CLASSIC PROBLEM IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMBINATORICS. YOUR TASK IS TO PROVIDE A DETAILED, STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION FOR PLACING EIGHT QUEENS ON A CHESSBOARD SUCH THAT NO TWO QUEENS CAN ATTACK EACH OTHER.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Objectives:**\n",
    "- EXPLAIN THE STRATEGY AND ALGORITHMS USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.\n",
    "- PROVIDE A CLEAR, DETAILED SOLUTION, INCLUDING INTERMEDIATE STEPS AND FINAL PLACEMENT OF QUEENS.\n",
    "- USE VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS (IF POSSIBLE) TO ILLUSTRATE THE SOLUTION.\n",
    "- ENSURE THE EXPLANATION IS ACCESSIBLE TO BOTH BEGINNERS AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain of Thoughts:**\n",
    "1. **UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the constraints: Eight queens must be placed on an 8x8 chessboard.\n",
    "   - Each queen must not share the same row, column, or diagonal with another queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CHOOSING AN APPROACH:**\n",
    "   - Describe the backtracking algorithm as a common and effective method to solve the problem.\n",
    "   - Explain how backtracking systematically searches for solutions by trying out different configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **IMPLEMENTING THE SOLUTION:**\n",
    "   - Start with the first row and place a queen in the first column.\n",
    "   - Move to the next row and place a queen in a column where it is not attacked by any previous queens.\n",
    "   - If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and move the queen to the next column.\n",
    "   - Repeat the process until all queens are placed on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **FINAL SOLUTION:**\n",
    "   - Once a valid configuration is found, present the placement of queens.\n",
    "   - Use an 8x8 grid to illustrate the positions of the queens.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **VERIFYING THE SOLUTION:**\n",
    "   - Ensure no two queens can attack each other by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Not To Do:**\n",
    "- NEVER OMIT STEPS IN THE SOLUTION PROCESS.\n",
    "- NEVER PRESENT AN INCORRECT OR INCOMPLETE CONFIGURATION OF THE CHESSBOARD.\n",
    "- NEVER FAIL TO EXPLAIN THE BACKTRACKING PROCESS CLEARLY.\n",
    "- NEVER IGNORE POTENTIAL EDGE CASES OR MISTAKES IN PLACEMENT.\n",
    "- NEVER ASSUME THE READER HAS PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT PROVIDING NECESSARY CONTEXT.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **STARTING THE BACKTRACKING ALGORITHM:**\n",
    "   - Begin at row 0, column 0, and place the first queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PROCEEDING TO THE NEXT ROW:**\n",
    "   - In row 1, try placing a queen in each column, checking for conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CONTINUING THE PROCESS:**\n",
    "   - Repeat the placement and conflict-checking process for each subsequent row.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BACKTRACKING WHEN NECESSARY:**\n",
    "   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen without conflict, backtrack to the previous row and move the queen to the next column.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **FINDING A SOLUTION:**\n",
    "   - After several iterations and backtracks, a valid configuration is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VISUAL REPRESENTATION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use a grid to show the final positions of the queens. Example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     . Q . . . . . .\n",
    "     . . . . Q . . .\n",
    "     . . . . . . . Q\n",
    "     . . Q . . . . .\n",
    "     . . . . . Q . .\n",
    "     Q . . . . . . .\n",
    "     . . . Q . . . .\n",
    "     . . . . . . Q .\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps and using the backtracking algorithm, you can effectively solve the Eight Queens Puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And unswer is... well agent generator already unsered visually in the prompt it self, and the result of the prompt above is to long and very explanatory (also in python code)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclution\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 nice and forcing us to define clear constraints to get clear solves (if any). ChatGPT works well for simple problems, but only with good prompts. For complex problems it might be too explanatory."
